          <h1>Projects</h1>

          <p>Our projects are aligned to the UN SDGs. We work on projects in self-organising teams. As the projects gain momentum, the teams grow and evolve to stay efficient and effective. Sometimes, the nature of a project means that a new organisation is formed, and spun out of the community.</p>
          <p>Interested in one of the projects below? <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/otioworkspace/shared_invite/zt-xmq4i3g5-NCcsdBywskh68vgqeL8NKA">Join Otio on Slack</a> and start contributing. We look forward to your input!</p>
